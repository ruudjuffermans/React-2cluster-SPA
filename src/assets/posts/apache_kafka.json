This is where Apache Kafka, an open-source stream-processing software platform, comes into play. Developed by the Apache Software Foundation, Kafka is designed to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. In this blog post, we'll dive into the world of Kafka, exploring its features, uses, and why it's become an essential tool in modern data architectures."
